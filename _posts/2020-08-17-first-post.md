First I created a github repository and selected the master branch in the Github Pages section of the settings of the repo.

I chose to replicate the plain minimalist Jekyll them available [here](https://github.com/heiswayi/the-plain).

So I cloned it and copied everythin in my repo, modifying the README.md, the `_posts`
